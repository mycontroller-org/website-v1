          MyController.org is an IoT automation controller for home, office or any place. Primarly this project was started to support  <a href="http://www.mysensors.org/">MySensors</a>. Later it was expanded to support other networks also. MyController.org was designed to run with limited resources. For instance, it can run on the first generation Raspberry Pi.
